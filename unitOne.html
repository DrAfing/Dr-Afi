<h3>1.1: Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3> 

<p> Computing and IT (information technology) has become an integral part of any business  and it is even more important in health care system,  In older days pre digital era, we have to go through and search physically for any thing of interest which takes time and sometime by missing a page you can miss while information of interest. This is even more important in disease epidemics to check previous mistakes so quick actions could be taken to stop the spread of  the disease.
</p> In IT system it is not only quick to send the information  but you can reach wider audiences in a short period of time. 
</p>
<h3>1.2: Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully 
</h3>
<p>Now there are wide range of resources available to have a maximum use and maximum productivity. It is important to identify hardware and soft ware and different programme to make a project a big success. I go to know a bit about html and css and sass, flex as it will be easy to have more control to change the contents, fonts size,  background and put images and animation. Furthermore slack will help to communicate and get help form mentors and colleague and good way of communication
</p>
<h3>1.3: Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website</h3>

<p>In making/creating  a website planning is utmost important and I will be using `TRELLO` to achieve this which has three coloums, things to do,  job in progress and jobs completed. This is a good programme as you can add the ideas when thy come to your mind, and move the job try/card to completed job tray/car. Trello helps to break the job in small do able  and achievable jobs.
     </p>
     <h3> 1.4: Describe the risks that might impact digital projects </h3>
<p>The biggest risk which could affect the digital projects is the hardware problem is computer malfunction or power outage. In power shut down you can get a power sooner but in case of hardware problem you will have no access to data and contacts and email or any other form of on line communication so it is important to have back up on external drive, thumb drive and data stored on line like in icloud. 
 </p>
<h3>1.5: Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </h3>
 <p>  It is important to identify the need of the organisation and need of the team who are working.together. During team building it is important to see the need of the team rather than single contributor and get hardware and software which works for all
</p> 
<h3> 1.6:Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
<p> Trello is a great programme and will keep me on top of things as I can divide the task in small manageable task then join the small task to bigger picture

 <h3> 1.7: Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
<p> companies act 2006 require business  to disclose certain pieces of information on their website  like company name, and contact information.<h3> 
</p>

</div>

<p>In May 2018, GDPR emulations came into effect. This legislations covers how personal information of customers or users is processed and accessed. It is important that some information about customers should not be made public like personal contact, bank accounts or other private information which could go into wrong hands
