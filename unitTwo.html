<h3>  2.1:Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change  approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
</h3>
<p> </p> have used flex  and visual Studio code to compile my website. Both programmes are user friendly and as I had no knowledge of computing and codes it was a bit daunting in the first few days but now I am loving it. 

Trello is also useful as you can add your thoughts and make your website better.
</p>
<h3> 2.2:  Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate  
</h3>
<p>I am blessed that I got wonderful teacher like Leon and Tom who are so so helpful. They taught me re different programme, being a biomedical science, I had little knowledge of codes but slowly they are winking in. 
</p>
    <p>In my learning curve Visual Studio Code was most appropriate for me to use as I can see what is padding and contents and box/container. It also helps me to see the contents and their position. 
    </p>
        <p>Similarly I can add and move the jobs in progress and done using trello. It was so easy to set and use it and I can use my time to focus more on my website contents and design. 
        </p>
<h3> 2.3:Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – 
</h3>
<p>As I did not know any thing when I started my website and it started improving every single day. My class mate also commented that how fast my website is improving. However this is not the end as I wish to improve my site by learning more codes, add more visual grabbing colours, more informative pictures, more educational animation and educational movie clips. 
</p>
<h3> 2.4: Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>

    <p>As I said I had no knowledge of website but now I am addicted to this and will keep on improving and learning more codes to make this more memorable and user friendly.  I look for jobs as a professor so I was working during the nights re job hunting and day time in codes ad website. Now I got a job offer and I can concentrate on website.  As  I am in the beginning of my learning curve I could only remember few codes but I will keep on improving. 
    </p>
<h3> 2.5: Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
</h3>
<p>
I have main page on my website and I also included link pages. I am a professor of medicine and I worked on rabies, herpes, respiratory disease, blood disease, abortion,  neurotropic viruses and diagnosis of cancer. I also teach zoonotic diseases. I wish to linked all these topics to my anchored or linked to website so all could  benefit.
