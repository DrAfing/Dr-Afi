        <h3> 3.1: Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and  efficiency
        </h3>
       <p> Sadly in dev programme one student dropped out on second day, I was only in the dev class and had little contact with master class in the first few days but then I started requesting help from master class team and every one was wonderful. There were times I was frustrated due to lack of my knowledge re IT programming but I learned fast but could have been more productive if I had only website programming  on my plate and not worrying about my job search. 
    </p>
    <h3>3.2: Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
    <p> I think in team work,  communication is the key to success. Now if I don’t understand any thing I ask from my colleagues or from teacher. In order to save time it is important to work on similar jobs like contents or styling etc. It is also important that via regular meeting you can discuss the problem so you don’t get depressed as you think you are the only one suffering from of lack of knowledge of codes, which in most cases not the case.
    </p>
    <h3>3.3: Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
</h3>
<p>  In future I would spend some time in planning the projects and divide similar task and put non one box like contents and heading  and use trello very early in the planning
</p>
    <p>  If I were to wok in the team I will make it sure that I will do my part of team work and communicate with team via slack or in person meetings
    </p>
        <p>   I would also look at the IT programme to refresh my knowledge re coding. 
        </p>
    <h3> 3.4: Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</h3> 
<p>   I would check my page carefully and make it sure that they work both on android and apple app. I will check that all hyperlink works. I will ask my colleague or a friend to look at the page to see if the page is user friendly.
